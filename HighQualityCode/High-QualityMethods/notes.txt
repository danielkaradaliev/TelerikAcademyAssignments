StyleCop says I have a Syntax error in MainMethod.cs on line 7? I don't see it...

I decided not to look at my C# Part 2 exam solution...
I had really bad luck, the code is so awful I cannot read it, I got really low score and barely 
made it to the next course... I don't want to have nightmares tonight :D
(Also, the problems for my exam are not public, so I can't read them either).
I am still in the Academy, though :)
