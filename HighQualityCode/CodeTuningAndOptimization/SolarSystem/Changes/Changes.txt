Bottleneck occures in the EarthRotation method in OrbitsCalculator.cs

field _startDays in the OrbitsCalculator.cs deleted! (never used)
constant double Step = 360 added!
the loop in the EarthRotation method deleted! (Causing the bottleneck)

3 Hours untill StyleCop is now happy with the code. Added some properties here and there, there is so much
more refacturing that can be done...But we should give this task to the guy who wrote the code in the first place,
right...
Actually, I am suprised that the program still executes correctly...
