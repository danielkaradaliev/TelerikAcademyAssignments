//Problem 18.* Trailing Zeroes in N!
//Write a program that calculates with how many zeroes the factorial of a given number n has at its end.
//Your program should work well for very big numbers, e.g. n=100000.
//Examples:
//n	trailing    zeroes of n!	    explaination
//10	        2	                3628800
//20	        4	                2432902008176640000
//100000	    24999	            think why
