//Problem 4. Print a Deck of 52 Cards
//Write a program that generates and prints all possible cards from a standard deck of 52 cards (without the jokers). The cards should be printed using the classical notation (like 5 of spades, A of hearts, 9 of clubs; and K of diamonds).
//The card faces should start from 2 to A.
//Print each card face in its four possible suits: clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades. Use 2 nested for-loops and a switch-case statement.
//output
//2 of spades, 2 of clubs, 2 of hearts, 2 of diamonds
//3 of spades, 3 of clubs, 3 of hearts, 3 of diamonds
//…  
//K of spades, K of clubs, K of hearts, K of diamonds
//A of spades, A of clubs, A of hearts, A of diamonds
//Note: You may use the suit symbols instead of text.
